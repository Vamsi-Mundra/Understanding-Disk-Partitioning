# Instagram_Clone_using_CPP
 
Instagram Clone is a c++ project which has one persona that is USER.

User Can SignUp providing a User Name. Users can then upload and download images. They can add comments to other user images. 


I have used instagram.bin binary file which will be 100MB as Data Base. Partitioning the file int different blocks and Managing all the independent blocks with Metadata made me understand how Disk Partitioning works in an Operating System.

FileStructure.H file contains the complete Data structures used in the project.

API.H contains all the functions required for the functionality of the project.

Working on this project, I have learned how the Disk Partition works, file system works in an Operating System.
