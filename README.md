# Instagram_Clone_using_CPP
 

Instagram Clone is c++ project which is of one Persona User.

User Can SignUp providing a User Name. Users can then upload and download images. They can add comments to other user images. 

I have  used instagram.bin binary file which will be 100MB. This is used as data storage for all the user information their images and comments to their images.

Working on this project made me to understand  how files are internally stored in hard disks.
